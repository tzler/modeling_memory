    - Howard & Kahana 2002: This paper describes the temporal context model (TCM) to explain explain recency and contiguity effects across time scales.
    - Polyn et al. 2009: This paper discusses the context maintenance and retrieval (CMR) model, and generalizes the TCM to address the recency, contiguity, and semantic (prior association) effects in free recall, as well as another effect due to ‘source’ which could refer to ‘was the word spoken by a man or a woman’ or ‘was the word presented when I was thinking about how big the item was or when I was thinking about whether it was living or not’.
    - Graves et al. 2016: Original DNC paper, which builds off of the Neural Turing Machine (NTM) and is also inspired by TCM.
    - Rae et al. 2016: Augmenting the NTM and DNC with sparse reads, writes, and memories so that it scales better.
