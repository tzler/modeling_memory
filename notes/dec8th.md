### WHERE ARE WE AT?

> - going over the levels of tasks in relation to context
> - relating kb to kf memory tasks that keven is working
> - looking for some way to operationalize type [3] tasks

**ANTHONY:** 

> while we're looking for **`[3]`**, we should do it with the understanding that no paradigm will be process pure - we're looking for a design that optimizes the probability 
**`[3]`**. 

> this also might change how we strategize around these tasks: 

**KEVIN:** a general framework for thinking of the task space: 

    (1) take two alternative forced choice match to sample task with one intervening blank screen
    (2) intervening delay screens with interveni

	ANTHONY: although we could titrate difficulty by varying similarity between distractory and target... 

    (3) same tasks with arbitrary delays

	DAN: how would people solve these tasks with arbitrary delays?
	ANTHONY: people will shift into a type [3] strategy

	(4) something similar to nicole Rust's work
      4a) every time you see a novel context object pair: perform task a (poke right)
      4b) the next time you see this context (object): perform task b (poke left)
    	- this blends into [3]

	(5) associative recognition paradigm


::: there was some generally discussion of how much computationally difficulty map onto "effort" in the task :::


### differentiating task rule learning and memory

> 	we need to not have shaping stimuli overlap with the experimental stimuli... but this gets tricky 

even for humans:

> - there is a world in which you might say "familiar" even on the first stimulus
> 	- that is, the signal coming from the hippocampus should be "This is familair" because of prior experience 
> - that is, there's has to be some task dependent memory retreival that's not necessarilly automatic


####this is a challenge for the models, as well as the conceptual framtwork we're using
	Kahana at al. will believe that there's one form of long term memory
	  	- memory signal is corr(feature vector, memory vector)
	  	- context is stored in the memory

	type [2] story
	  	- updating in PRC shifts memory representation in HPC
	  	- local updating

	type [3] story
		- false alarm rate isn't as high as it should be for a PRC dependent
		- Malcom Brown
  			- recognition memory is preserved in rodents with HPC lesions


> - it seems like there are two general ideas on the table:
>     1. learning about task structure
>     2. expressing memory in a way that humans do

**ANTHONY:**

> - we should be thinking about what happens in the delay for humans:
> - the computations during the "delay" introduces change as a function of the task
> - fMRI work on changing HPC activity at [baseline](http://www.pnas.org/content/98/22/12760.full)

**DAN:**
	
> - we shouldn't be worrying about how these are partitioned in the literature, we should be bringing them together
> - we might take a hit on something like a (1) but we should get better at (5)

**ANTHONY:**

> - the task hierarchy we're defining about might actually be inverted
> - kids are good on [3] and [2], but need to be explicitly instructed on [1]
> - some of Favell's [work] (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028570900198) on developmental differences in memorization 
- does this suggest anything about the nature of the model?
	- that is, the familiarity signal itself isn't hard, but "maintaining" a signal in working memory is what needs to be learned
 
**DAN:**

> - PRC is about synaptic modification, not maintenance (FPN)
> - changes in synaptic strenght are one way of getting familiarity
> - e.g. some batch updating occurs ***from trial to trial***
