where are we at? 
    - still focusing on understanding the memory tasks we're interested in modeling
    - Anthony sent out a few papers related to hierarchical task
    - Aran and Kevin have been talking about how we might use Kevin's framework

KEVIN: 
  when would my "memory" tasks fail? 
    - most trivial memory task: 
      - adding a fixed time delay
      - requiring some level of recurrance, not yet external memory 
      - ANTHONY: what do you mean by time delay? 
      - implicit to the model: image -- > touch 
        so timing delays can be 
        1) stimulus encoding. performing a 1-back task, basically 
        2a) longer retention interval with no stimulus in the interval (model implicitly touch to proceed) 
        2b) longer retention interval with stimulus being presenting in the interval (less mnenomic demands) 
        3) [...tyler missed this...] 
  
DAN: difference between a fixed delay and an arbitrary delay
        
ANTHONY: how do humans solve this task? 
  - PRC lesions impair performance with samples that are equally familiar
    - if they're not equally familiar perirhinal can solve this task 
  - debate in the literature
      "you don't need the hippocampus to do working memory tasks" 
      but imaging studies suggest that HPC is online for this
      one world view: the hippocampus plays a role in maintaining task information in a "working memory" like way
      
    three stories: for even simple 'memory' tasks 
    [1]   FPC: maintaining relevent task representations 
    [2]   PRC: signal detection like - familiarity signal 
    [3]   HPC: pattern completion/reinstatementi/reactivation 

DAN 
  [2] is an activity state story 
  both [2] and [3] involve synaptic changes 

ANTHONY
  a puzzle in recognition decisions tasks [2] 
  - repitition suppression occurs throughout the ventral visual stream, but lesions of PRC result in recognition deficiets
    - priming occurs throughout IT 
    - behavioral expressions of memory
    - speeds up RTs 
    - amnesics will be faster at the task
        - but they're at chance in making simple recognition memory decisions 
        - Larry Squire: something migical about memory vs. Saksida 
    - decision is IN THE DECISION 

  a story for [3]
    - using the familiarity along with all the other features to recover contextual information also present at encoding 
    - TASKS require recovering contextual information
        - decision is NOT IN THE STIMULUS 

ANTHONY 
  
  [1] vs [2] 
  - attentional focus distinguishes between these two. 
  - from the lesion literature:
    - EP is a densly amnesiac patient, like HM 
    - EP can maintain an item in memory and repeat it later
    - EP can't if there are distractors
    - IF YOU BREAK THE ATTENTIONAL FOCUS and you don't have some rapid plasticity (in PRC) you can't solve the task
  - ALSO: predictible interactures 
    - unreliable statistics reqiure different more sophisticated performance
  
  [2] vs [3]
  - context retreival 
  - that is, not just recovering the item/task in memory, but other information incident to the task

  literature has been: 
    - the hippocampus is really about time 
      - post encoding intervals of < 2 seconds, probably not HPC 
      - post encoding intervals of > 8-10 secnod, probably HPC
       
           (!) EARL PHASES (!) 
      
      - in match to sample task 
        - it's the first sample that matters 
        - intervening stimuli don't (distractors)
        - IT representations of targets are "maintained" during empty intervals
        - IT representations of targets are NOT maintained if there are distractors
        - linear readout of IT doesn't track familiarity judgments
          - linear readout of PFC does

MOVING FORWARD: 
    - Kevin: we're going to want to go after [1] vs [2]
    - Aran + tyler: going after [2] vs [3]
    - ptutils is almost ready 
    - Aran creating a github repository for project notes/literature/code/etc.
